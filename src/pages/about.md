title: About PyCon MY
---

Since it’s first inception in 1991, the usage of the Python programming
language has increased explosively in the past years. Python is now being
used in multitude industries, from the web, to film production in
Industrial Light and Magic and even for NASA.

PyCons are conferences about Python and usually done by grassroots volunteers
within their geographical area. PyCon started first in the United States in
2003 in Washington D.C, and have grown worldwide and done yearly in many regions
and countries like Europe, Japan, Australia, Singapore, China South Korea,
India and Malaysia.

Malaysia had its first mini PyCon in 2014. In 2015, we had our first big PyCon
MY. After organizing PyCon MY for many years, we realized that getting the
Python community to get together for a few days a year to share knowledge and
compare experiences allows the growth of ideas and also the exchange of skills,
which will lead to a spillover of greater cooperation even after the conference
is over. Stronger ties between developers and users of Python can be nurtured
better when there is real human interaction, which is a big plus to the
community. But we need to have continuity and provide the opportunity for people
to get together to see the effects in the long run, and just providing a space
for a few days a year for people to get together doesn’t seem to be enough.
There should be more to that, because continuity and horizontal connections are
the key.

In order for us to have continuity and transparency going forward (especially
concerning sponsorship monies), on 17th Dec 2015, we have incorporated PYCON
MY PLT (LLP0006642-LGN) as a Limited Liability Partnership under the laws of
Malaysia.

The current board members of PYCON MY PLT consists of:

1. MOHAMAD HILMI BIN MOHAMAD BAKHARI (Chair for PyCon MY 2018)</li>
2. TANG ING WEI (Chair for PyCon MY 2019)</li>
3. FUNG OI WEI (Chair for PyCon 2020)</li>

The board can be contactable via [board@pycon.my](mailto:board@pycon.my).

As defined in its contract of incorporation, PYCON MY PLT’s purpose are as
follow:

<ol type="a">
  <li>Organizing and hosting a yearly PyCon MY</li>

From 2016, PyCon MY and PyCon APAC will be organized and managed by PYCON MY
PLT, with PYCON MY PLT will be the beneficiary of any sponsorship. We will
also try to work with other python or open source communities to organize events
beneficial to the community as a whole.
