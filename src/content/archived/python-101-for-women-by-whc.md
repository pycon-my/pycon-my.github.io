Women Who Code, a women's technology groups which is [helping us with our outreach program to women for PyCon APAC](http://pycon.my/2017/02/20/pycon-my-tie-up-with-women-who-code-whc/) is having a [Python 101 introduction course on python](http://wwckl-python101.peatix.com).

The uptake was very quick and unfortunately, at the time of this post the event has already been **sold out.**

If you're a woman in technology, and have interest in learning python, we suggest that you follow or get in touch with [WHC](https://twitter.com/WomenWhoCode) for more news of their upcoming python series.
