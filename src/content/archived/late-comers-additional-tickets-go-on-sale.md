We've [closed our regular ticket sales on 7/18](https://twitter.com/pyconmy/status/754840740723765248) but are happy to announce that we'll be having additional tickets for those of you who were not able to purchase them on time. Our past experiences have shown that no matter what you do, there will be people emailing you complaining he or she can't buy tickets a week before the event, so here you go!

Introducing the **Late Comers** ticket: It's priced slightly lower than the regular tickets, _but will NOT include the event tshirt_. Everything else stays the same as the regular ticket. **These tickets will go on sale right up until a week before the conference: August 19th 2016.**

You can purchase the tickets [here](https://peatix.com/sales/event/162223/tickets).
