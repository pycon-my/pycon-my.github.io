We would like PyCon to be accessible to everyone who wants to come and get involved, but one of the hurdles to accessibility is the financial burden that attending a conference imposes on attendees. So one of the new things that we're trying to do for PyCon APAC 2017 is to give out financial aid to selected participants. You can read more about our Financial Aid program philosophy [here](http://pycon.my/2017/03/27/financial-aid-for-pycon-apac-2017/).

We have already received and [approved 10 recipients in the 1st batch of Financial Aid](http://pycon.my/2017/07/22/announcing-our-financial-aid-recipients/). For the 2nd batch of Financial Aid recipients, [we originally had a budget for another 2 recipients](http://pycon.my/2017/07/28/financial-aid-reopened-2-more-grants/), but after getting strong support from our regional friends, we now have managed to make additional space for another extra 3 recipients, making it 5 recipients for this batch. One recipient from the 1st batch have informed us that he could not attend PyCon APAC, so we moved his grant to another person from the 2nd batch.

_After announcing that we are looking for 2 more recipients for our financial aid program, we were surprised to receive quite a number of applications still. So instead of selecting 2, we selected a total of 6 applicants to receive this financial grant._

_Congratulations to the following applicants from the 2nd batch:_

_1\. AYYW (XXXXXX-XX-XXXX)_ _2\. LJY (XXXXXX-XX-XXXX)_ _3\. MAZ (XXXXXX-XX-XXXX)_ _4\. RNM (XXXXXX-XX-XXXX)_ _5\. YKX (XXXXXX-XX-XXXX)_ _6\. ZDC (XXXXXXXXX)_

_Once again, all successful applicants are reminded to bring their Photo ID for identification to collect the financial aid. The fund will be provided to you on-site at the conference itself. We reserve the right to not process the disbursements in the event that any of the applicants fail to attend the conference._

_Thank you for your submissions. See you at the conference._
